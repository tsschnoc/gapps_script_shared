This plugin will link phone numbers in web pages you visit, so that when you
click them a call will be place with Skype, or any other application you
configure to respond to a callto: URL.

Installation
============

1. Clone the git repository
2. Open the Chrome extensions window (Menu -> Tools -> Extensions)
3. Click the + next to "Developer Mode" if it's not already expanded
4. Click "Load unpacked extension...", and choose the extension's directory on your drive

Using The Plugin
================

This plugin simply turns phone numbers into links like "callto:+18005551212".
Chrome will then hand that off to the OS to figure out what to do with it.
Skype on Windows should register a handler for this type of URL. I'm not sure
about Mac.

Linux
-----

In Linux, Chrome uses the `xdg-open` command to open links like this. Skype
doesn't automatically register a URL handler though, so that must be done
manually.

1. Download the latest version of `action_handler.py` by Philipp Kilmann, from
   http://www.kolmann.at/philipp/linux/skype_action_handler/
2. Place that somewhere on your PATH (/usr/local/bin, for example).
3. Open a terminal and issue the following commands:

    gconftool-2 -s -t string /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/callto/command '/usr/local/bin/action_handler.py "%s"'
    gconftool-2 -s -t bool /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/callto/enabled true

4. You may need to edit the `action_handler.py` script to account for the fact
   that Chrome URL encodes the phone number. So `+18005551212` becomes
   `%2B18005551212`. Change the correct lines to look like the following:

    import dbus
    import sys
    import re
    import string
    import urllib

    ...

    user = ""
    cmd  = ""
    multiuser = 0
    arg1 = urllib.unquote(sys.argv[1]);

    re1 = re.match('^(skype|callto|tel):\/?\/?([\+]?[\.\w-]+[;[\.\w-]+]?)\/?$', arg1);
    re2 = re.match('^(skype|callto|tel):\/?\/?([\+]?[\.\w-]+[;[\.\w-]+]?)\?(\w+)\/?$', arg1);
    re3 = re.match('^(skype):\/?\/?\?(chat)\&(blob)=([\.\w-]+)\/?$', arg1);

Modification
============

Please do feel free to modify this plugin at will. The basic functionality is
in the file contentscript.js. It is very simple at the moment. If you make
additions that you would like to see included, just send me a Github pull
request.
